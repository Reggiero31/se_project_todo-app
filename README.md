todo-app

Give a brief description of the project here. Feel free to give it a different name. Hello my name is Reginald Robinson , I am working on my sprint 7 project which is the todo-app and I enjoy it and I am learning at the sametime. However I am creating a todo app which is like a checklist when you logged in and click the boxes that you want to check it will come up blue. Therefore I have to make sure the function of that app is working properly and everything is aligned with my codes with no buggs in it and I have to test it first before I submitted to my database.
